# Authenticated Zustand Shopping Cart System

## A simple cart system in which user can make login and register themselves if not logined and on authentication user can add products to his/her cart also cart will show the updated list of products that have been added by the user in his/her cart.

**Technologies/Frameworks**: `nexts.js` + `zustand` + `api which sends back token [reqres.in](https://reqres.in)` + `shadcn and tailwind`

For the time now user can only register themselves using credentials as email: eve.holt@reqres.in and password: cityslicka because the dummy api only sending us back token on these credentials.

**Updates:** Need to make an api on our own server which returns back a jwt that is verified.
